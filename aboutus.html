                <p><font size="3px">Inkworks Printing is a group of businesses that provides services to customers, 
                especially top-notch printing services, gaining their trust and strengthening their loyalty to our brand.</font></p>

                <p><font size="3px">Inkworks Printing began as an office as well as a stationery supplier retailer with only five employees, 
                overseen by a couple of enthusiastic information management students. Later, discovering there was a need for quick and 
                high-quality printed stationery and associated products, the company entered this market through a strategic collaboration 
                with associate printers.
                <p>We name it Inkworks printing because the word Ink was taken from the words <b>“ink”</b> which shows the main tools that are needed 
                when it comes to printing. Furthermore, inks also help the printing process to work successfully. We want to provide the 
                community, especially students, with good, high-quality printing services at an affordable price.</p>
                <p>Our ambition is to develop into the most renowned printing firm among consumers, and our objective is to discover a 
                trustworthy source of high-quality printing services. Furthermore, our business goals are to dominate consumers' printing 
                service choices and to satisfy them with our exceptional customer service.</font></p>
